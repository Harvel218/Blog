# How to Get a FREE Letter from Santa Sent To Your Home


Although I’m rapidly becoming older, I am still a firm believer in jolly old Saint Nick, Santa Claus, Father Christmas – whatever you call him. He is part of the magic of Christmas. And while overspending on presents and overspending on food can put people off the whole festive thing, it’s still good to hold on to the magic as much as possible. 

Get a free letter from the Post Office/Royal Mail
The Post Office elves are helping this year by delivering children’s letters to Santa. It’s not just a one-way communication method though. After your child has sent their letter, they will be delighted when they might get a reply before Christmas Eve. A little elf told me that Father Christmas may be able to reply in braille or large print if this is of use to your child.

it’s simple to get a letter back from Royal Mail, just remember to include your full name and address so he can write back. Have your child send their letters to:
If you want a reply in Welsh, send your letter to Sion Corn, Ogof Sion Corn, Gwlad Y Ceirw, XM4 5HQ.
There is a cut off when the letters need to be received. Letters need to be sent in before the second Friday of December, so make sure to send any letters before 11 December 2020. Be aware that Father Christmas is very busy at this time of year. While he tries to write back, it can’t be fully guaranteed, but he’ll do his best to get Royal Mail to deliver the letter.

RNIB – for blind and partially sighted children
If your child has a visual impairment, the elves helpers at RNIB are also supporting with letters in different formats. Write a letter as you usually would and send it to RNIB along with an application form from their website. The form will give you a chance to specify which format you want the reply in:

English or Welsh
Braille – uncontracted
Braille – contracted
Large print – please specify the font size
Audio CD
Email (16 point attachment)

Please send the child’s letter and completed application form to:

Santa Claus
RNIB
Midgate House
Midgate
Peterborough
PE1 1TN
Letters must be sent to them before Tuesday 1 December 2020 to give Father Christmas a chance to read the letter and reply. You can also email the letter to santa@rnib.org.uk and receive the reply via email. Make sure email letter requests are received by Monday 21 December 2020. As it’s the season of giving, they would accept a donation, but don’t feel you need to if money is really tight.
